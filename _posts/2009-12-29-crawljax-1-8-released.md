I&#8217;m working on a cool project for my master thesis: [Crawljax][1]. Crawljax is a website crawler that supports JavaScript. This is done by opening a real browser such as [Firefox][2] and controlling it via [WebDriver][3]. The core of Crawljax does only that: crawling websites. However, there is a very flexible plugin system available that allows you to do all kinds of cool things such as creating a static mirror of an AJAX website or creating test suites for you AJAX webapplications.

[Download Crawljax][4] now and give it a try!

To get a better grasp of what is possible, have a look at the Google Tech Talk a colleague of mine did:
