If your Bandit's steering is not correctly aligned, your steering will be off and you might even grind the wheel against other parts. The Traxxas Bandit comes with a simple TQ transmitter, which does not support steering endpoint adjustment.

At first look it doesn't seem possible to fix this, however due to the nature of how the servo is mounted (perpendicular), you can influence the steering angle. You cannot increase or decrease the total "steering span", but you can move the middle point, therefor moving a too small or too large steering angle just a bit to the other side.

First unscrew the top of the steering assembly housing using the four screws you can clearly see in the picture below.

Next, loosen the screws in the steering rods so the steering assembly can be turned upside down just like on the picture below. If you can't access these screws, move the housing a bit first, or steer all the way left/right. Don't use too much force though, as you might damage the servo.

Now the trick is to loosen the servo saver and move it one tooth out of the center. This will force you to lengthen or shorten the "28mm threaded rod" connecting the servo saver with the steering assembly. This small length adjustment influences the endpoints right and left, therfor fixing the problem.
