One week after I bought my Hero, I found out it is possible to install a newer radio-firmware on the HTC Hero. This has all kinds of positive improvements such as better reception and better battery life. I don&#8217;t know where these radio updates come from (I guess from HTC themselves), but they aren&#8217;t published on the HTC website. You can find them at the [xda-developers forums][1] (currently, there is a [newer update][2] that is not listed in that thread) and they can be installed by saving them to the SD card of your Hero as &#8220;update.zip&#8221;. Next, turn off your phone and turn it on again by holding home+poweron. Enjoy the better reception and battery life!
