The web has been plagued by cookie consent popups and banners since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has come into effect. See for yourself when you visit articles like [this](https://techdows.com/2015/02/enable-test-reader-mode-firefox-nightly.html) and [this](https://www.minitool.com/news/how-to-enable-use-reader-mode-in-chrome.html). Now what if I told you there is a one-click solution to hide those banners and make your reading experience on websites such as these examples a lot simpler?

I'm talking about the "reader mode". When available for a website, it is displayed as an icon at the end of the url bar in Firefox. The same is true for Chrome, but you first need to enable it at [chrome://flags/#enable-reader-mode](chrome://flags/#enable-reader-mode). Safari on iOS includes it in the menu at the left of the url bar.

Now open the [first example](https://techdows.com/2015/02/enable-test-reader-mode-firefox-nightly.html) again and click on the reader icon without acknowledging the cookie consent popup. That's better, right? As an added benefit you get dark mode and typography settings as well.

I believe not a lot of users know about this button, especially because Chrome doesn't want to show it by default. As you can imagine it's quite a life saver for informative sites and articles that you just want to read and don't care about further interacting with.
