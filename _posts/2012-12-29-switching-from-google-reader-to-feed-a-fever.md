In my opinion Google Reader has become a lot less nice to work with by completely removing the share functionality and modifying the interface in a way I didn&#8217;t like it. I recently found <a href="http://feedafever.com/" target="_blank">Feed a Fever</a>, a self hosted, one time purchase RSS reader ($30). I bought and configured it and so far I really like it. The interface looks nice and is very fast compared to Google Reader. Feed a Fever is also able to detect duplicate posts and important articles (in the &#8220;Hot&#8221; section), meaning I will save time by being able to focus more on the important things.
