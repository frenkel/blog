With only a few days left till the official support period of Windows XP comes to an end, I was amazed by these two head-lines ([via](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/not-dead-yet-dutch-british-governments-pay-to-keep-windows-xp-alive/)).

Two governments are using tax payers' millions to extend support for a twelve (!!) year old product. They were betting that Microsoft would announce another Windows XP support extension period, but this time they lost their bet, resulting in a multi-million euro loss. I can't believe how tax payers' money is flushed down the toilet like this. The only brightside of the support deal seems to be that Microsoft, not the governments, is forcing a migration to at least Windows 7 during the life-time of the contracts.
