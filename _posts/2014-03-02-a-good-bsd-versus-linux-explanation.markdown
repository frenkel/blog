The following link is a good written article about some of the differences between the BSDs (mostly FreeBSD) and Linux. I especially liked this explanation:

*It's been my impression that the BSD communit{y,ies}, in general, understand Linux far better than the Linux communit{y,ies} understand BSD.*
