I finally got the DD-WRT firmware working on my Fonera 2100. I had been trying to get it up and running for a while, but couldn&#8217;t get it to work. Apparently the current &#8220;stable&#8221; release of DD-WRT, v24 SP1 doesn&#8217;t want to boot. As soon as I finished the installation in RedBoot and ran &#8220;reset&#8221; the Fonera stopped responding. Today I tried the current &#8220;unstable&#8221; release of DD-WRT, v24 preSP2 (build 11522) and it booted right away!  
So far I&#8217;ve been able to get client-mode to work. Next step: client bridge-mode!
