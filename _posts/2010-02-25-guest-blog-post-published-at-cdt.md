The launch of pleaserobme.com received a lot more media attention than we had expected. We were on a number of international radio stations, national television etc.

Furthermore, Adam Rosenberg of <a href="http://cdt.org" target="_blank">Center for Democracy & Technology</a> (CDT) asked us to write a guest blog post. Of course we were interested in doing so, because it gave us another opportunity to make people aware of the potential problems of sharing your location with the whole world. The post was pusblished today and can be read on <a href="http://www.cdt.org/blogs/cdt/over-sharing-and-location-awareness" target="_blank">the CDT website</a>.
