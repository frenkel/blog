A week ago I finally decided which case I wanted for my Nexus 7: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008NMCPTQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B008NMCPTQ&linkCode=as2&tag=frankgroeneve-21" target="_blank">Poetic Slimline Portfolio Case for Nexus 7 Tablet</a>. A case that sort of resembles the Apple Smart Cover for iPads. I ordered it through Amazon and received the case yesterday.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-323" title="Poetic Slimline Case for Nexus 7" src="http://frankgroeneveld.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/0001978_slimline_google_nexus_71-300x300.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />][1]

My first impressions are good. The front cover feels nice with the microfiber finish on the inside and it can be folded back in order to make the Nexus stand on a table for example. The case doesn&#8217;t add much weight or thickness to the tablet. Furthermore, the front cover can be folded in such a way that you can type on table much easier than without the it. The case&#8217;s magnets make sure it stays closed in my bag and when opening the case, the tablet will automatically wake.

You can find the case on Amazon:
