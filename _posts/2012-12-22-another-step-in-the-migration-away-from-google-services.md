Last year I switched from Gmail to <a href="http://fastmail.fm/" target="_blank">Fastmail</a>. I did this because I got fed up with the changes Google made to Gmail and because their IMAP service and the webmail client only became slower.

Well, a few weeks ago Google anounced another bitch-slap for their users:<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2012/12/winter-cleaning.html" target="_blank"> deprecating Exchange Active Sync</a>. This basically means anybody with an Apple iOS device will need to use the Google apps in order to have push mail support and syncing contacts and calendars becomes a lot more difficult as well. To make things worse, Windows Phone users will not be able to sync their contacts or calendars at all.

I own a Windows Phone device, so I started to search for a better alternative to Fastmail (they don&#8217;t have calendars and don&#8217;t have a sync mechanism for contacts). I finally found hosted Zimbra to be a viable alternative. I opened up an account at <a href="http://www.xxlwebhosting.nl/" target="_blank">XXL Webhosting </a>for only â‚¬ 4 a month! As an added benefit none of my email, calendar or contact information is stored in the US anymore, because this is a company based in the Netherlands.
