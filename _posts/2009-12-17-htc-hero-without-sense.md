A few weeks ago I bought my first smartphone: The HTC Hero. It&#8217;s been a great purchase since the beginning, but I was wondering how Android would &#8220;feel&#8221; without all the HTC customizations such as the SenseUI. So, I installed an [AOSP (Android Open Source Project) ROM for the Hero][1]. It was a build of the Android 2.0.1 sources combined with the Google closed-source applications such as Gmail, Talk and Calendar. This was a really great experience, because all the features I use worked great. There was just one problem that is quite important for me: battery life. Somehow this ROM seems to drain the battery at night. When I first brought up this issue, nobody had noticed it, but quickly other people started to monitor their Hero&#8217;s and it appeared they were experiencing the same problem. I&#8217;ve switched back to the official ROM until this is solved, but you should really give this a try. The developers of the ROM did a great job!
