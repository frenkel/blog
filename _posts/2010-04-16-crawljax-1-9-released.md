We just released [Crawljax 1.9][1], the project I&#8217;m working on for my master thesis. It&#8217;s mostly a &#8220;bug fix and clean up&#8221; release, but some important changes were made as well.

You can download the release at [our project page][2]. There is also a full changelog [available][3]. If all goes well, this release will end up in the Maven central repository as well. Whats keeping you from using it?
